# AEM Docker Configurations

This repository contains the docker configurations for various AEM Docker configurations.

To initialize this repository, run the script: 

	download-assets.sh
	
This will download the AEM JARs from the 6D Box.com FTP site.  Once the assets are 
downloaded you should be able to run the individual docker setup.  The `assets` directory 
is ignored and will not be committed into source control.
